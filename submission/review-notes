Dear App Store review team

The in-app purchases are located in the "Module Store" in the upper left corner of the 
home screen.

The in-app purchases unlock features. The locked features can only be seen after importing a data set.
When the user works with his or her own data set, some features are locked.

The easiest way to import a data set is probably to got to "Export projects, select a single project, email it to yourself.
Go to email, open the attachment in this app (Amberbio app), and finally go to "Import Data" and tap import for this file.

Some locks will then be present on the home screen. These locks can be unlocked from the "Module Store".

Sincerely,

Morten Krogh.
