The Amberbio app allows scientists to analyze and visualize biological data sets on mobile
devices. The app performs calculations and visualizations directly on the device. 
The data is always available and can be visualized and analyzed in real time.

Various types of data can be analyzed in the app including protein, microRNA, and gene expression
data. In general, data consisting of measurements for molecules across a set of samples can be analyzed.
Even non-biological data sets can be analyzed.

The app can perform several statistical tests such as t-tests, Mann-Whitney tests, ANOVA tests,
paired t-tests, and linear regression tests.

The app can perform unsupervised classifications such as 2D and 3D principal component analysis,
hierarchical clustering, and heat maps.

Data can be visualized in various ways giving the user a better understanding of the data.

Various customizable color figures can be produced. The figures can be exported to either pdf or png files.

New derived data sets can be produced by normalization, logarithmic transformation, sample
removal, molecule removal, or selection of molecules.

The app can display tables of molecules. The tables are sortable and searchable, and can be exported to txt files.

Import and export of data and figures can take place through email and cloud storage
providers. Projects can be exported to a database file that can be used for backup and transfer of
data to ther devices. These database files facilitate sharing of projects between collaborators.
