The Amberbio app allows scientists to analyze and visualize biological data sets on mobile
devices. The app performs calculations and visualizations directly on the device. 

Various types of data can be analyzed in the app including protein, microRNA, and gene expression
data. In general, data consisting of a matrix of rows and columns can be analyzed.
Even non-biological data sets can be analyzed.

The app can perform several statistical tests such as t-tests, Mann-Whitney tests, ANOVA tests,
paired t-tests, and linear regression tests.

The app can perform unsupervised classifications such as 2D and 3D principal component analysis,
hierarchical clustering, and heat maps.

Values for individual molecules can be plotted giving a fast overview of the data set.
Data can be visualized and summarized in various ways giving the user a good understanding of the data.

Various customizable color figures can be produced. The figures can be exported to either pdf or png files.

New data sets can be created by normalization, factor elimination, logarithmic transformation, sample
removal, molecule removal, or selection of molecules.

The app can display tables of molecules. The tables can be sorted, searched, and exported to txt files.

Import and export of data and figures can take place through email and cloud storage
providers. Projects can be exported to a database file that can be used for backup and transfer of
data to other devices. These database files facilitate sharing of projects between collaborators.
